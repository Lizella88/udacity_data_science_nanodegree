# Project 1: Write a data science blog post
For this project I wanted to analyse data about the possible positive effects of music on mental health issues. I found a survey on Kaggle that collected data concerning the participants favorite music genre, their symptoms and whether they feelt hat music has a positive effect on them. Though the data set is rather small with only 736 participants, I was so interested in this topic due to my own experience with mental health issues, that I just had to have a look at it. The blog is available on Medium.
